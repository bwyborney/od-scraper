OD-scraper by Ben Wyborney
Hey, thanks for using this thing I made! I apologize in advance for the low quality of my code, and I need
to make it clear that I am NOT a programmer and I have NO idea what I'm doing - I just bodged this thing
together to make my life at work a little bit easier. Feel free to use this however you'd like, and
definitely feel free to fork this project if you're a more skilled coder than me. If you do choose to fork
this and improve it, I'll probably end up using your version, honestly. You can send me feedback at
bwyborney@protonmail.com as well. Thanks again for checking out my project, and stay safe!

### Scraper - sends HTTP requests to the pages for each SKU, then checks for availability
def scraper(txtSKUS) :
    skus = open(txtSKUS)

    # These are all the possible terms I've found on the website so far
    searchTerms = ["Free delivery", "Free next business day delivery", "Out of stock for delivery", "Available for future delivery", "This item is no longer available", "other"]

        # Make HTTP request and parse it using BeautifulSoup

        # Only parse div tags
        onlyStatus = SoupStrainer("div")

### Results sorter - pretty simple, just adds the product name to the correct list
def resulter(writeValue, writeTitle) :
    if writeValue == "Free delivery" :
        freeDel.append(writeTitle)
        print("freeDel")

        futDel.append(writeTitle)
        print("futDel")

        cantHave.append(writeTitle)
        print("cantHave")
    elif writeValue == "other" :
        other.append(writeTitle)
        print("other")


### Finalize - write all the product titles to a file under a heading that shows their availability
def finisher() :
    # Append the results to a file called results. If there isn't such a file already, creates one
    resultPage = open("results", "a")

    # Products marked with "Free delivery" or "Free next business day delivery" are listed as available

        resultPage.write(r3 + '\n')

    # Products marked with "Out of stock for delivery" or "This item is no longer available" are listed as unavailable
    resultPage.write("----------" + '\n' + "---Unavailable---" + '\n')
    for r4 in outStk :
        resultPage.write(r4 + '\n')

        resultPage.write(r5 + '\n')
    for r6 in other :
        resultPage.write(r6 + '\n')


    resultPage.close()


### Title grabber - gets the name of the product from the webpage
def titleGrabber(URL) :
    # Make HTTP request
    webpage = requests.get(URL)
    # Parse only h1 tags with the two specific attributes that are used for the product title and only the product title on every page
    onlyTitle = SoupStrainer("h1")

    bsoup = asoup.find(class_="semi_bold fn", itemprop="name")
    # Not sure why I chose this name
    thingy = 0
    # This is a clunky and lazy way to deal with the fact that the parser above return extra information, including tons of blankspace and the contents of the p tag inside the h1 tag
    # Strip the blankspace, and only pull the first line, which is the title of the product
    for stringy in bsoup.stripped_strings :
        if thingy == 0 :
            bstitle = stringy
        thingy += 1
