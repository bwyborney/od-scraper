---NOW SORTED BY PRIORITY---

Set a scheduled run every couple hours that emails the results to the store

Add options to pull the price

Add the date and time to the filename

Add options to show only available, backordered, or unavailable SKUs. Alternatively, this will probably take care of the issue as well:
  Instead of putting the results in a text file, put them in an HTML file with a little CSS and Javascript. That way they can look really nice, be collpasible and sortable, and still open on literally any device. This will also make it really easy to transition to a webserver, as the user can just be served the results.html file in-browser and never have to leave the website
  Make the SKUs into hyperlinks that will create a popup with a full screen barcode (designed for mobile at this point, though maybe if a desktop display is detected it can make a smaller but still scannable barcode)

Add the ability to quickly check a single SKU

Add sorting options (sort by price, sort by name)

Look into creating a tunnel rather than a separate request for each page, both to save time and to prevent the website from blocking users who aren't using a VPN

Add a graphical frontend

Compile everything into a package that users can download and use without having to understand Python or have to use a terminal emulator or install independent packages

Percent complete indicator?




---BRAINSTORMING---
Put the thing on a webserver

Make it into an android app and look into loading it on the zebras

Make a nice-looking website that people can use to download or use the thing

Make it usable for other stores, like best buy, target, etc.



Todo right now:
Clean up the code
  Actually make a README
  Push a GitHub release as a command-line-only program with instructions and screenshots (maybe look at other peoples' stuff, like spotify tui, to see how they do it)
